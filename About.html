                <p>My name is Ahslie Mae Bacunawa, and I'm a nineteen-year-old student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Fatima University, Dash 5. While my academic focus is on the technical aspects of information technology, my true identity is a vibrant blend of creativity and analytical skills. This unique combination fuels my passion for both the technical and artistic realms, shaping my aspirations and driving my progress.

                    My artistic side finds expression in drawing and video editing. Drawing has always been a source of solace and self-expression for me; it allows me to translate my thoughts and emotions into visual narratives. This creative outlet is not merely a hobby, but a fundamental aspect of my personality that informs my approach to problem-solving and innovation. Similarly, video editing has become a powerful tool for me to communicate ideas effectively, to craft compelling stories, and to experiment with different visual styles and techniques. This skill allows me to translate abstract concepts into tangible, engaging experiences.

                    I believe in collaborative problem-solving and empowering others to achieve shared goals. My style of mediation is inclusive, clear communication, etc. These experiences have not only strengthened my organizational and communication skills but have also instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility and a commitment to teamwork.

                    Even seemingly unrelated pursuits, such as my ability to solve a Rubik's Cube, demonstrate my dedication to analytical thinking and problem-solving. The complex logic and strategic thinking required to solve the cube have translated into a more methodical and efficient approach to dealing with challenges in other areas of my life.

                    Currently, I am actively expanding my technical skills by learning HTML, a core web development language. I am eager to combine my technical knowledge with my creative abilities to build engaging and user-friendly websites. My ambition is to become a game designer or designer. My portfolio, which you can explore further, provides a comprehensive overview of my development and achievements in my academic and creative endeavors. I invite you to explore the unique blend of creativity and technology that defines my approach to learning and professional development.</p>
