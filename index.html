    <p>My name is Ahslie Mae D. Bacunawa, and I am an aspiring IT student with a passion for both technology and digital art. This portfolio showcases my ongoing learning journey, highlighting the skills I am developing and the progress I am making in these dynamic fields.

    My passion for IT began with a love of problem solving and a desire to create something tangible. The challenge of building something new, something that works, is incredibly rewarding. Currently, I am focusing my studies on Java programming, web development, and CSS. However, my true passion lies in design. The ability to build immersive worlds and captivating narratives is what truly excites me. My ultimate goal is to become a game designer, creating games with rich, compelling storylines and innovative gameplay mechanics that resonate with players.

    This portfolio is a snapshot of my journey so far, a testament to my dedication to continuous learning and growth. It is a work in progress, reflecting my continued exploration and development in both technology and art. I am excited to see where my passions take me, and I am eager to continue honing my skills and making meaningful contributions to these vibrant fields. Thank you for taking the time to view my work.</p>
